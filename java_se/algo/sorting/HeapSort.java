/*
 * Heap Sort uses a binary heap tree to sort the data structure. First, it
 * fills the data structure into a tree, and then balances it. Then the 
 * top-most element is popped and added to the end of the returned data 
 * structure.
 * 
 * Time Complexity = O(N*log(N)), Space Complexity = O(1).
 * 
 * (+) Useful when memory is extremely limited.
